# Open-source release is here: https://github.com/Real-Sim-XIL/FIXS

Real-Sim is funded by Department of Energy (DOE)-Vehicle Technology Office (VTO)-Energy Efficient Mobility Systems (EEMS) program. It is part of the core tools of EEMS.

**Project Lead**: Oak Ridge National Lab\
**Project Team**: University of Georgia, University of Texas-Dallas

Real-Sim is a multi-resolution X-in-the-loop simulation framework to support inclusive testing and evaluation of CAVs before actual implementation in the real world. Real-Sim framework connects different simulation components and integrates various traffic and vehicle simulation tools, virtual environments, and XIL systems through a Flexible Interface for XIL Simulation (FIXS). Connections among different tools are transparent to users and handled by the interface behind the scenes. Co-simulation of various vehicle and traffic simulation tools with different XIL systems can be easily achieved and become a transparent “plug-and-play” process to users.
